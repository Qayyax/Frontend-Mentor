## My process
I started with writting out the HTML structure of the page, and then link it to my styles.css file.
In the CSS process I struggles with centering the div and generally with understanding box model. I watched more videos on youtube to understand the concept and asked a mentor on the frontend mentor slack help channel.
Then I played around with units in the inspect feature on chrome which helped me with postioning the QR code image in a box with H2 and P.
I also watched videos on how to include the google fonts into my HTML. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to input google fonts into my HTMl
I learnt the importance of Box model, Though I still have a lot to learn on it to be more confident with it.
I learnt how to move box with CSS


### Continued development

I want to continue practicing and solving projects in the future. This project made me realise to not just learn from tutorials but by practicing I get to learn how to be more efficient with my codes.
